title: 4 Things to Look for in a Graphic Designer
---

There are thousands and thousands of designers out there these days with computers being so readily available. How is one to know how to choose between them?! In this article you will read up on the best ways to decide which one is the right designer for you. Below is a short list of 4 ways to determine which designer is the right one for your needs.

**1.** Find a designer with a skill set that complements yours. If you are good with editing on photoshop but horrible at illustration you should look for a designer that has experience in illustration. Balance is very important in design and it will show when you have a well balanced design team.

**2.** Find a designer who is willing to part with their ideas and concepts to more strongly emphasize yours. (After all you are the one hiring them!) You don't want to end up stuck working with someone who tries to push their ideas on you, it is your design after all!

**3.** Review previous work that each prospective designer has worked on. Measure strenghts and weaknesses to help decide which one would better suit your needs. You can not just hire a designer based on their credentials. It is always important to see a body of previous work to measure prospective end results.

**4.** Which designer do you have a good rapport with? When hiring a designer make sure that there is good rapport with them before you begin working with them because no one wants to work with someone who has a different way of working on projects. Similar design style and agreeable work conditions are both very important for successful design projects.
