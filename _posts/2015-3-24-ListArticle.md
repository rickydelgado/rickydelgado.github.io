title: The Top 10 Time Saving Plugins for Photoshop
---

***1. Pixel2Vector***

Pixel2Vector is a very impressive tool that converts any pixel graphics to a fully scalable vector shape. It seems to work really well and I’ve never seen anything like this before. Looks like a real time saver for sure.

***2. WebZap***

WebZap is a web developer panel extension for Adobe Photoshop that is designed to help streamline the design processes undertaken by website user interface designers during the mock up and wire framing phases of web site development.

***3. Velositey***

Velositey by Kieran Black & Dan Ross is a completely free Photoshop Plugin to help you Prototype the design of your website in seconds in Photoshop. The idea is to spend more time perfecting the details and styling and less time on all that boring stuff. 

***4. Zeick Photoshop SVG Export***

Photoshop CC plugin allows you export vector shape layers to SVG files. SVG’s are incredibly lightweight scalable vector graphics that have lots of uses, this plugin makes creating them incredibly easy.

***5. PNG Hat***

PNG Hat is the better way to slice and export PNG’s from Photoshop. As well as exporting slices PNG also employs a 3 stage compression process that makes your PNG’s around 70% smaller without losing quality, plus you can automatically export retina ready files at the same time too.

***6. SuperSpray***

Super Spray allows you to fill a shape with a collage of png files. You can use it in a variety of ways. It’s a tough one to explain, but if you look at the preview images you’ll see just how powerful this plugin can be

***7. Interface Tools***

Interface Tools Photoshop Plugin by Elliot Jackson does a lot of simple things very well. Turn snapping on and off, trim a document or “save for web” with one click. Some great time savers as well as having access to some of the more common tools all in one place.

***8. EasyTask***

Easytask is a plugin that brings your to-do list directly into any CC app. Create tasks, manage them (by simply dragging tasks around to change their order) and mark items as complete. No more window switching!

***9. Guide Guide***

GuideGuide provides pixel accurate columns, rows, midpoints, and baselines can be created based on your document or selection with the click of a button. Available for CS6, CS6 & CC.

***10. Glifo***

Glifio. For the first time ever it’s now possible to create an icon web font right from Photoshop. Glifo lets you export all of the icon layers from any PSD out into a ready to use web font.


These are some great plugins that will definitely improve your photoshop experience. I personally love GuideGuide because it implements grids that are so much better than the stock ones from Photoshop!

Sound off in the comments and let me know if you actually used some of these before or if you plan on using in the future!
