### Not just a Dr. Anymore

I learned today in class that it is becoming more popular to use static site generators to more quickly load web pages. Pages that would have taken much longer being sourced from a different server previously were slow and loaded with problems but Jekyll, which is the most popular static generator goes to show that
Jekyll isn't just a doctor anymore. It is a powerful source for webhosting that has been able to cut down the load time for web pages significantly.
