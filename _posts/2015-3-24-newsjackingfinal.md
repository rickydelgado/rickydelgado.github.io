title: Make Your Designs as Hot as Ultra Tickets this March!
---

  As many of you know March in Miami can be a crazy place. This is mostly to do with Miami's uber famous electronic music concert,Ultra Music Festival. Having planted its roots here in 1999 over 100,000 people attend every year. Using effective design and marketing strategies are always important. Without the right product placement and effective and attractive designs, Ultra may never have become the giant event that it is today.
  
  This is just an example of how impactful design can make a difference in what people react to. Originally, Ultra was a small concert on Miami Beach, but as it caught on it evolved. They changed venues and focused a lot more on design of their promotional materials, merchandise collaterals, and even down to the tickets. They now have a monster following and sell tickets like hotcakes. 
  
  Hiring a designer from Miami can help you to reach an international and multicultural following. Unlike many other places, Miami is a melting pot of so many different cultures and races. Using this to our advantage, we accrue and take in these ways of life of the people around us that we interact with every day. This reflects in our design work and will prove most advantageous when hiring a designer.
  
  To see some of my designs check out the portfolio section of my website. I always strive to do the best work possible for my clients and it reflects in the customer satisfaction responses I have received from past experiences with design clientele.
