title: What Color is the Dress Really?
---

These days the question on everyone's mind is "WHAT COLOR IS THAT DRESS?!"
For those of you who have been living under a rock, there has been a photo of a particular dress going around the internet right now causing all kinds of controversy. The dress which is blue and black appears to be white and gold to people all over the world. For those of you who have never seen this photo before here it is below. VVV

Anyways, this dress controversy is a perfect example of why you need to hire a designer with a keen sense of color and perception. If you hire someone who has little experience with color theory they may overlook subtle details such as the appearance of certain elements in their designs. There is just so much that can go wrong with graphic design work that it is better to hire someone who knows what they are doing to get the job right. No one wants to end up unhappy with their end results because the designer was using an older monitor while working and accidentally made your spokesperson a nice light shade of blue. When they were trying to airbrush them with tones of gold.

Like the dress, in graphic design it is important to know that perception is reality. Picture this: You have just finished a transaction with your designer and they have been paid. You saw all the designs on their computer which you notice that the colors are a little bit off. You get back to your office or home computer and open the files on your computer. Even though the intention to make the spokeswoman have a golden glow is there, she now has a healthy blue glow. If this was meant to be an ad for treatment for accidentally ingesting too much silver (Yes, having high silver levels in your blood can actually turn your skin blue), you are on the mark. Otherwise you are out of luck and out of time. While the other designer has completed his job, you are left high and dry with designs covered with what you can only describe as a professional looking Smurf.

Hiring someone with the proper credentials and experience can mean the difference between boosting sales and looking rather foolish. In the future make sure that you do your research in order to achieve superior results and complete work.
