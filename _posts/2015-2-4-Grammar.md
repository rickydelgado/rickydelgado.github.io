title: Grammar is Key
---

You can have the best web site in the world, with the best coding, great images, amazing content and everything else a website needs to be great but, just one grammatical error could bring ruin to your page.
Imagine a website with impeccable web copy. Now imagine we are looking at a page about vacations. If you are reading the headline of an article that says "10 trips under $500" and you click for more details, what would you do if on the next page underneath the article there was a link that said "Clcki Here for More iNformation". I'll tell you what I would do. I would leave that page.

Sometimes we become too relient on spellcheck and hope that whatever software we are writing our copy on will catch all our mistakes, but proofreading can prove to be most important when it comes to impressing and attracting new clientele. A misspelled word, a misplaced comma, or a missing apostrophe can mean the difference between client acquisition and potential customers leaving the page.
As writers of web copy we need to make sure that we are on top of all aspects of our copy, not just the content but also the format and grammar.
