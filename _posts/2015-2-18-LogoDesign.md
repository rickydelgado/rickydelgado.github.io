title: What Everyone Ought to Know About Logo Design!
---

There are a set of rules that must be followed when creating a logo. This, afterall, is the first impression that customers get of a company. If you make a bad first impression you are likely to not get any more work or referrals from that particular client anymore due to the lack of quality.

Always make sure to do preliminary work such as sketches. This is important so that you can visualize what your goal is going to be before translating it to the computer for finishing. Make sure to make at least 10-15 different designs to pick from before you start designing on the computer.

Balance is also very important in logo design. Our minds percieve images with evenly distributed weight and balance(colors, size, and graphics) as being pleasing to the eye and appealing to customers. Sometimes depending on the circumstance balance may be broken but definitely it is the safest approach to please your clients.

Size is a very important factor to consider as well because you have to see if the logo will have the same impact on a billboard as it would on a computer as an icon. Usually the smallest version is the most difficult so start out by printing it on a letterhead. 

Make sure to use color accordingly to the image of the company. Also rememeber to try and stay away from overly bright colors or colors that are too far from eachother on the color wheel. You must make sure also that the logo looks just as good in color as it does in black and white and grayscale. You do not want to design a logo that looks great in color but becomes unintelligible when translated to another color scheme such as grayscale.

These are just some guidelines to follow to create a successful logo. If you make sure to follow these rules you will be sure to create some impactful high quality work.
