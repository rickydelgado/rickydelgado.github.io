##Forming Space

In Form and Space I have learned to understand the work that goes into finishes on design products. Currently we are working on making our own creative book by hand. There are many methods that go into this one item including sewing or gluing the book togehter, deciding on size and textures for the cover, and attaching all the finished pieces together by hand. This is going to be a challenge.
