title: Why Choose Premium?
---

   If you have compared my services with other design web sites you will see that when it comes to price and design there is no better choice.
   I offer two levels for every service which are the Basic and the Premium. It can be applied to any product or service that I offer. 
   Below you will see the table comparing the product with the the premium versions.

| Packages        | Basic Price           | Premium Price |
| -------------   |:------------------:   | ---------:    |
| Logo Design     | $150.00               | $399.00       |
| Branding Package| $599.00               | $1,200.00     |
| Book Covers     |    $250.00            | $700.00       |
   
Although it appears to be more expensive to get the basic package consider this: With premium packages I offer extended service on your products. In the branding package one of the advantages is that we will continually create multiple designs with the same logo and scheme for different products at a discount since your company is on file with the premium services. To see all the advantages check out my pricing page for more details on premium and basic packages. This being said going with the traditional basic package may be the right thing for you but you should definitely look into the premium package as it covers all the bases.
