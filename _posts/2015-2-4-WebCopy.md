title: Your website will be more successful if you just follow the right path.

Web copy is just as important these days as actually building the code of the website. Even if you have a killer design, if you do not have engaging material for a prospective customer to read, you have already lost their attention. In order to attract the customers to your site you have to make them come to you with subtle calls to action. 
One example would be if you were selling a face cream you would use something along the lines of 
"5 top causes of wrinkles in women over 30".
This would cause a woman who would potentially use your face cream to click on your site. The reason being for this that people are constantly bombarded with blatant advertisements (up to 5,000 per day) and since they are constantly seeing these ads your brain by design begins to filter them out. Once you have the reader convinced that it is an article pertaining to a problem that they are having you have reeled them in and they are now interested in reading more about your product. All in all the most important thing about web copy is to be subtly persuasive.
