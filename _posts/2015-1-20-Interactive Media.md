###Interactive Media

When I started this class last week I was very intimidated because I had never worked with interactive media and basic html coding before. Now one week later I am much more confident that I will be able to handle this class because I feel that I learned so much in one week. I am glad that I picked up on this quickly and am looking forward to continuing to learn more about interactive media writing in this class.
