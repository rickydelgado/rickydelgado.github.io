title: Little Known Ways of Getting Noticed on the Web

First of all, you need to push yourself and get good at designing.

I'm not the best designer out there, and you don't need to be either;however, you do need to be pretty good. I like to think that there is an 80/20 rule applying here. That is to get 80% good takes a few years of work, to get that last 20% and get to the top of your field takes a lot more effort (and/or talent). I've never won any awards, but my work is functional, appealing and well-liked. I admire cool and clever designers, but know that I still have a long way to go.

I try to do as much work as I can find. Do I think you need talent to be a good designer? Not particularly. It sure helps, but I like to think anyone would be able to get good at designing from just sheer hard work.

Be Likeable, Excited and Enthusiastic! The people who are going to hire you are ... well, people. And like any other people, they are going to like someone who is nice, friendly, warm, interested in them and interested in their project. A friendly tone in emails, a genuine interest in people, enthusiasm about work, it all helps!

A large number of jobs for most freelancers come from referred clients. Do a good job for one person and they tell others for you. Most of all the jobs I've worked were referrals and I think being referrable is extremely important. Focus on the characteristics that make people want to work with you, and be reliable, very reliable. Reliability is one of the most prized characteristics for a freelancer. As a client finding someone you can rely on means solving a problem permanently. Many freelancers are not reliable, and this presents and easy way to stand out from the rest.

Design the portfolio you think your clients want to see! The language you use on your portfolio site, the pieces you choose and the presentation should all be pitched at the clients you are trying to land. People want to see what they want to buy, not something completely different. So if your target market is edgy, make it edgy, if it's corporate, make it corporate. Spend the time defining your brand and target market and then create a portfolio that will appeal to them.

If you make sure to follow these guidelines you will be way more noticed on the web and in person for referrals and design work which is very very important!
