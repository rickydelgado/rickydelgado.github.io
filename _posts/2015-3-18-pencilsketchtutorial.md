Today's how-to guide is "How to create a pencil sketch using a regular photo file" This is a fun and easy effect that can be applied to almost any photo file.

STEP 1: Open the file you wish to create a pencil sketch with and DESATURATE the image by using CMD+SHIFT+D

STEP 2: Next, you will want to duplicate the image layer by pressing control+click on the layer thumbnail and selecting duplicate layer. Rename this layer GRAYSCALE

STEP 4: Next you will open the levels dialog box by clicking Image > Adjustments > Levels. Once the dialog box has opened up you will select the middle slider and drag it to .75. This achieves full tonal range of the image.

STEP 5: Now we are ready to add some line work. You can start this by duplicating the grayscale layer that we made earlier and rename it "Glowing edges"

STEP 6: In order to create the glowing edges effect simply enter the filter gallery by clicking Filter > Filter Gallery... Once open click on the tab named "Stylize" and click glowing edgs. Adjust the sliders on the side panel of the filter gallery and make the following changes: edge width (3), edge brightness (13), and edge smoothness (6). Click ok to save changes and return to editing your image.

STEP 9: Now we are ready to add some shading to our image to achieve the desired effect. Duplicate your grayscale layer once again and rename it "Blur". Once you have done this move the blur layer to the top of the stacking order. (The top space in the layers panel)

STEP 10: Now that were almost done let's add some blur to the blur layer. Click on Filter > Blur > Guassian Blur and enter a value of 25. WARNING: Don't freak out if you are seeing your image as a big blur, we will fix that in the next step.
