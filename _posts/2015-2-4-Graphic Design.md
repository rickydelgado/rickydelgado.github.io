title: 4 Things to Look for in a Graphic Designer
---

There are thousands and thousands of designers out there these days with computers being so readily available. There are however ways to decide which one is the right designer for you. Below is a short list of 4 ways to determine which designer is the right one for you.

**1.** Find a designer with a skill set that complements yours. If you are good with editing on photoshop but horrible at illustration you should look for a designer that has experience in illustration.

**2.** Find a designer who is willing to part with their ideas and concepts to more strongly emphasize yours. (After all you are the one hiring them!)

**3.** Review previous work that each prospective designer has worked on. Measure strenghts and weaknesses to help decide which one would better suit your needs.

**4.** Which designer do you have a good rapport with? When hiring a designer make sure that there is good rapport with them before you begin working with them because no one wants to work with someone who has a different way of going about their work.
