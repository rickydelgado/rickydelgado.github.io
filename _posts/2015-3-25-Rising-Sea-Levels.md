title: Rising Sea Levels on Florida's Coast
---

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — On a recent afternoon, Scott McKenzie watched torrential rains and a murky tide swallow the street outside his dog-grooming salon. Within minutes, much of this stretch of chic South Beach was flooded ankle-deep in a fetid mix of rain and sea.

“Welcome to the new Venice,” McKenzie joked as salt water surged from the sewers.

Due to the increased risk of global warming from the destruction of our ozone layer it is arguable tha said Leonard Berry, director of the Florida Center for Environmental Studies at Florida Atlantic University is correct about at least one thing: “This is not a future problem. It’s a current problem,” Berry is a contributing author of the National Climate Assessment, which found that sea levels have risen about 8 inches in the past century.

By one regional assessment, the waters off South Florida could rise another 2 feet by 2060, a scenario that would overwhelm the region’s aging drainage system and taint its sources of drinking water.

“It’s getting to the point where some properties being bought today will probably not be able to be sold at the end of a 30-year mortgage,” said Harold Wanless, chairman of the geological sciences department at University of Miami. “You would think responsible leaders and responsible governments would take that as a wake-up call.”

There are few places in the nation more vulnerable to rising sea levels than low-lying South Florida, a tourist and retirement mecca built on drained swampland.

Yet as other coastal states and the Obama administration take aggressive measures to battle the effects of global warming, Florida’s top Republican politicians are challenging the science and balking at government fixes.

 “I’m not a scientist,” Gov. Rick Scott said, after a federal report pinpointed Florida – and Miami in particular – as among the country’s most at-risk areas. He and other Republicans warn against what they see as alarmist policies that could derail the country’s tenuous economic recovery.

Democrats hope is to win over independents and siphon some Republicans, who are deeply divided over global warming. Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmental activist, has pledged to spend $100 million this year to influence seven critical contests nationwide, including the Florida governor’s race.

The battle in the country’s largest swing state offers a preview of what could be a pivotal fight in the next presidential election.

 “They don’t believe in science. That’s ridiculous,” former Gov. Charlie Crist said at a recent campaign rally in Miami. “This is ground zero for climate change in America.” In 2007, Crist, then a Republican, declared global warming “one of the most important issues that we will face this century,” signed executive orders to tighten tailpipe-emission standards for cars and opposed coal-fired power plants.

***There are multiple instances of proof that this is not only a current problem but it is a growing problem.***
-	Miami Beach has been known to flood (even on sunny days)

-	Sea levels have risen about 8 inches in Miami Beach in the last century

-	Miami Beach is being forced to spend $400 million on an elaborate pumping system to be able to cope with routine flooding

-	The state has spent about $130 million on coastal flooding in the governor’s  first term, as well as millions on environmental restoration.

-	Ft. Lauderdale has also shelled out millions in order to restore beaches and a section of the coastal highway due to storm damage and a breached sea wall.

-	Hallandale Beach, which lies on the Atlantic Coast between the two cities, has abandoned six of its eight drinking water wells because of encroaching seawater.

Although Rubio had voted for Crist’s landmark environmental measure, he soon hammered the governor for what he called a “cap-and-trade scheme.” Seeking support from the growing tea party movement, he distanced himself from the vote.

Amid meetings with conservative activists and Republican leaders in New Hampshire last month, Rubio said: “I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it.” Proposals to cut carbon emissions, he said, would do little to change current conditions but “destroy our economy.” Rubio later said he supports mitigation measures to protect coastal property from natural disasters.

Scott and Florida Republicans share his current views.

Denouncing “job-killing legislation,” they repealed Crist’s climate law, disbanded the state’s climate commission and eliminated a mandate requiring the state to use ethanol-blended gasoline. Asked about climate change recently, Scott demurred, Meanwhile, Miami Beach is bracing for another season of punishing tides.

“We’re suffering while everyone is arguing man-made or natural,” said Christine Florez, president of the West Avenue Corridor Neighborhood Association. “We should be working together to find solutions so people don’t feel like they’ve been left on a log drifting out to sea.”
