Above is a collage in support of the freeing of Miami Seaquarium's famous marine mammal, Lolita the orca whale. Due to the recent protests and disaffiliations by corporations with the seaquarium many people are lobbying for the freedom of Lolita who has been captive in a tank that is much too small for her for 43 years.
