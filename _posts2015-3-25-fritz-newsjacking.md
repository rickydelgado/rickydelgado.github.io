title: Fritz Keeps Dropping the Ball, or Rather the Hotdog!
---

I'm sure you're wondering who Fritz is. After all he has never been a big talker so you likely haven't heard of him.

Fritz is a golden retriever, much like AirBud from the popular Disney franchise. Unlike Airbud however, Fritz is a little less coordinated than his fellow basketball playing "Buddy".

This week a video has begun going viral of Fritz attempting to catch food that his owner throws over and over (see the image below).

This being said you don't want to be a Fritz and keep working with the same boring graphic designers that don't produce the results that you want in the time frame that you want them in. 

I have the experience and skill required to meet all of your design needs. I will make sure not to "drop the hotdog" so to speak and ensure only the best results, satifaction gauranteed!

As for Fritz, well he is going to have to get some more practice in before he can join the local high school basketball team
